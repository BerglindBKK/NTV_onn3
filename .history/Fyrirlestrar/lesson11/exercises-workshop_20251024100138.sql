-- ============================================
-- PostgreSQL Workshop - Today's Practice Exercises
-- ============================================
-- Work through these exercises during today's workshop
-- Focus: SQL Fundamentals (CRUD operations, WHERE, aggregates, GROUP BY)
-- Note: JOINs will be covered in the next session!

-- ============================================
-- SECTION 1: WARM-UP (Basic SELECT)
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 1.1: View all movies
-- Write a query to see all data in the movies table
select * from movies


-- Exercise 1.2: View all directors
-- Select all columns from the directors table
select * from directors


-- Exercise 1.3: Count total actors
-- Use COUNT to find how many actors are in the database
select count(*) from actors

-- Exercise 1.4: Preview actors
-- Select just the name and nationality columns from actors
-- Limit to first 10 rows
select name, nationality from actors limit(10)


-- ============================================
-- SECTION 2: CREATE TABLE
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 2.1: Create a simple table
-- Create a table called 'streaming_services' with:
-- - id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
-- - name (VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
-- - monthly_price (DECIMAL(5,2))
-- - launch_year (INTEGER)
CREATE TABLE streaming_services (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    monthly_price DECIMAL(5,2),
    launch_year INTEGER
);

-- Exercise 2.2: Create a table with constraints
-- Create a table called 'awards' with:
-- - id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
-- - name (VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL)
-- - year (INTEGER CHECK year >= 1900)
-- - category (VARCHAR(100))
CREATE TABLE awards (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER CHECK (year >= 1900),
    category VARCHAR(100)
)


-- Exercise 2.3: Create a junction table
-- Create a table called 'movie_streaming' to link movies to streaming services:
-- - movie_id (INTEGER)
-- - service_id (INTEGER)
-- - available_date (DATE)
-- - PRIMARY KEY should be (movie_id, service_id)
-- Note: We'll add foreign keys later
CREATE TABLE movie_streaming (
movie_id INTEGER,
service_id INTEGER,
available_Date DATE,
PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, service_id)
)

-- ============================================
-- SECTION 3: INSERT - Adding Data
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 3.1: Insert a single movie
-- Add a new movie with these details:
-- title: 'The Matrix Reloaded'
-- release_year: 2003
-- duration_minutes: 138
-- box_office_millions: 742.1
-- rating: 7.2
-- watched: FALSE


-- Exercise 3.2: Insert a director
-- Add director: 'Denis Villeneuve', birth_year: 1967, nationality: 'Canadian'


-- Exercise 3.3: Insert an actor
-- Add actor: 'Timothée Chalamet', birth_year: 1995, nationality: 'American'


-- Exercise 3.4: Insert a genre
-- Add a new genre called 'Horror'


-- Exercise 3.5: Insert multiple movies at once
-- Add these three movies in a single INSERT statement:
-- 1. 'Blade Runner 2049', 2017, 164 min, 267.7M box office, rating 8.0
-- 2. 'Arrival', 2016, 116 min, 203.4M box office, rating 7.9
-- 3. 'Sicario', 2015, 121 min, 84.9M box office, rating 7.6
-- Set watched = FALSE for all


-- Exercise 3.6: Insert with specific columns
-- Insert a new movie but only provide:
-- title: 'Test Movie', release_year: 2024, watched: FALSE
-- Let other columns use their defaults or be NULL


-- Exercise 3.7: Insert a review
-- Add a review for movie_id = 1:
-- reviewer_name: 'Your Name'
-- rating: 5
-- review_text: 'Amazing movie! A perfect conclusion.'
-- review_date: use CURRENT_DATE


-- Exercise 3.8: Insert into junction table
-- Link movie_id 1 (Avengers: Endgame) to genre_id 3 (Comedy)
-- Note: This is just for practice, Endgame isn't really a comedy!
-- Insert into movie_genres table


-- ============================================
-- SECTION 4: UPDATE - Modifying Data
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 4.1: Mark a movie as watched
-- Update the movie 'Dunkirk' to set watched = TRUE
-- and watched_date = '2024-01-15'
-- Hint: Use WHERE title = 'Dunkirk'


-- Exercise 4.2: Update a movie rating
-- Change the rating of 'Barbie' to 7.2
-- Hint: Find it by title


-- Exercise 4.3: Update box office earnings
-- The box office for 'Dune' increased to 450 million
-- Update the box_office_millions for this movie


-- Exercise 4.4: Update multiple rows
-- Mark ALL movies from 1994 as watched with watched_date = '2020-06-01'


-- Exercise 4.5: Update with calculation
-- Increase the rating of 'Forrest Gump' by 0.1
-- Hint: SET rating = rating + 0.1


-- Exercise 4.6: Update a director's information
-- Update Steven Spielberg's birth year to 1947 (if it's currently 1946)


-- Exercise 4.7: Update multiple columns at once
-- For the movie 'Test Movie' (that you inserted earlier):
-- Set duration_minutes = 120, rating = 6.5, and description = 'A test movie for practice'


-- Exercise 4.8: Update with WHERE and multiple conditions
-- For all movies released after 2020 with rating above 8.0:
-- Set watched = TRUE


-- ============================================
-- SECTION 5: DELETE - Removing Data
-- ============================================

-- ⚠️ WARNING: Always use WHERE clause with DELETE!
-- Without WHERE, you delete ALL rows!

-- Exercise 5.1: Delete a specific review
-- Delete the review you created earlier (the one with your name)
-- Hint: WHERE reviewer_name = 'Your Name'


-- Exercise 5.2: Delete the test movie
-- Delete the movie with title 'Test Movie'


-- Exercise 5.3: Delete old reviews
-- Delete all reviews from before 2010
-- Hint: WHERE review_date < '2010-01-01'


-- Exercise 5.4: Delete movies with low box office
-- Delete movies that made less than 30 million at box office
-- Hint: Only 'The Shawshank Redemption' matches this (made 28.3M)


-- Exercise 5.5: Delete a genre
-- Delete the 'Horror' genre you created earlier


-- Exercise 5.6: DANGEROUS - Don't actually run this!
-- Write (but DON'T execute) a query that would delete ALL movies
-- This is to understand the danger of DELETE without WHERE
-- Comment it out with /* */
/*


*/


-- ============================================
-- SECTION 6: ALTER TABLE - Modifying Structure
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 6.1: Add a new column
-- Add a column called 'imdb_id' (VARCHAR(20)) to the movies table


-- Exercise 6.2: Add a column with default value
-- Add a column 'is_available' (BOOLEAN) to movies with DEFAULT TRUE


-- Exercise 6.3: Drop a column
-- Remove the 'imdb_id' column you just added from movies table


-- Exercise 6.4: Add a constraint
-- Add a CHECK constraint to movies table ensuring rating is between 0 and 10

-- ============================================
-- End of Workshop Exercises
-- ============================================

-- Great work! You've practiced:
-- ✅ CREATE TABLE
-- ✅ INSERT (adding data)
-- ✅ UPDATE (modifying data)
-- ✅ DELETE (removing data)
-- ✅ ALTER TABLE (changing structure)
-- ✅ SELECT with WHERE (filtering)
-- ✅ ORDER BY & LIMIT (sorting and pagination)
-- ✅ Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM, etc.)
-- ✅ GROUP BY & HAVING (grouping and filtering groups)

-- Coming in the next session:
-- 🔜 JOINs (combining data from multiple tables)
-- 🔜 Relationships (foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-many)
-- 🔜 Complex multi-table queries

-- Remember:
-- - Always use WHERE with UPDATE and DELETE!
-- - Test queries with LIMIT first
-- - Re-run seed-data.sql if you mess up your data
-- - Ask your instructor if you're stuck!

-- Good luck!
